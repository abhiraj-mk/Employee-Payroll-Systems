Employee Payroll System
A simple command-line based Employee Payroll System developed in Java. The project allows users to add, view, search, delete employees, and generate employee payslips.

Features
Add new employee records
Prevent duplicate Employee IDs
View all employees
Search employee by ID
Generate employee payslip
Calculate gross salary
Calculate net salary
Delete employee records
Validate salary values
Handle invalid menu input
Runs completely through the command line
Technologies Used
Java
ArrayList – for storing employee records
Scanner – for taking user input
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts

Employee Details
The system stores the following information for each employee:

Employee ID
Name
Department
Designation
Basic Salary
Allowances
Deductions
Salary Calculation
Gross Salary
Gross Salary = Basic Salary + Allowances
Net Salary
Net Salary = Gross Salary - Deductions
How to Run
1. Install Java
Make sure Java JDK is installed on your computer.

Check the Java version using:

java -version
Check the Java compiler using:

javac -version
2. Compile the Program
Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

javac Main.java
3. Run the Program
After successful compilation, run:

java Main
Main Menu
When the program starts, the following menu is displayed:

========================================
       EMPLOYEE PAYROLL SYSTEM
========================================
1. Add Employee
2. View All Employees
3. Search Employee
4. Generate Payslip
5. Delete Employee
6. Exit
========================================
Enter your choice:
Example
After adding an employee, the system can generate a payslip similar to:

========================================
              EMPLOYEE PAYSLIP
========================================
Employee ID  : 101
Name         : Rahul
Department   : IT
Designation  : Software Developer
----------------------------------------
Basic Salary : 30000.00
Allowances   : 5000.00
Gross Salary : 35000.00
Deductions   : 2000.00
----------------------------------------
Net Salary   : 33000.00
========================================
Input Validation
The program includes basic validation:

Employee IDs must be unique.
Salary values cannot be negative.
Invalid menu input is handled using exception handling.
The program displays an error message when an employee ID is not found.
OOP Concepts Used
This project demonstrates several Java programming concepts:

Class and Objects – Employee class represents employee information.
Encapsulation – employee data and related methods are grouped inside the Employee class.
Methods – separate methods are used for adding, searching, displaying, deleting, and generating payslips.
Constructor – initializes employee information when an object is created.
ArrayList – stores multiple employee objects.
Exception Handling – handles invalid user input using try-catch.
Loops and Conditional Statements – used for menu operations and employee searching.
Limitations
Employee data is stored only in memory.
Data is lost when the program is closed.
The project does not use a database or file storage.
It is designed as a command-line application.
Future Enhancements
The project can be improved by adding:

File-based data storage
Database connectivity using JDBC
Employee update functionality
Payroll history
Employee login/authentication
Monthly salary reports
Tax and bonus calculations
Graphical user interface
